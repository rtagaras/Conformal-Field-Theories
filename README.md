# Conformal-Field-Theories

This repository includes typeset solutions to some of the exercises that I solved while learning about conformal field theories. 

Qualls_Problems.pdf contains solutions to some, but not all of, the problems given in https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04074. 

Exercises.pdf contains solutions to the problem set written by Dalimil Mazac as part of the 2018 Simons Bootstrap Collaboration summer school.

Pufu.pdf contains the solution to one of the exercises in the problem set written by Silviu Pufu as part of the 2017 Simons Bootstrap Collaboration summer school.
